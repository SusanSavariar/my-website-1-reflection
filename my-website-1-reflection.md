1. Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.
  https://github.com/SusanSavariar/SusanSavariar.github.io

2. Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
-On GitHub, go to the main page of the repository.
-In the right sidebar of the repository page, click  to copy the clone URL for the repository.
-Open Terminal (for Mac and Linux users) or the command prompt (for Windows users).
-Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
-Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 2.
-Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

3. Describe what open source means.
Open source is a developement model that promotes universal access i.e can be freely used and changed by anyone.

4. What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
As a novice looking into the world of developing, I think the open source model is great. It allows for transparency, collaboration, and rapid prototyping. If I created proprietary code and it was available for everyone I think I would have different thoughts.

5. Assess the importance of using licenses.
Licenses allow an individual to grant specific permissions for others to use. Licensing is a great alternative to releasing a product into the public domain, where you relinquish any right to the product.With licensing, you hold the original copyright.

6. What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
I struggled the most with staging the commit and pushing it to github. I would find myself in a different branch or actually just forget the process to push to github.

7. Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
I eventually wrote down the steps in an easy format on paper and i followed the process exactly. I struggled a lot with this challenge. I found youtube videos on how to push to git and also a forum on stack overflow that helped me.
